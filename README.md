# MultiSourceBot 

## Overview
The **MultiSourceBot** is an AI-powered tool designed to gather, analyze, and synthesize information from multiple sources efficiently. Built using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**, it enables advanced retrieval and reasoning for structured insights. The application is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface. The project is managed in a **Pipenv** virtual environment to ensure dependency management and reproducibility.

## Key Features
- **Multi-source Data Retrieval:** Uses LangChain to fetch and process information from various sources.
- **Graph-based Processing:** Implements LangGraph for structured reasoning and flow control.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Built with Streamlit for seamless user experience.
- **Efficient Dependency Management:** Utilizes Pipenv for managing Python packages.

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain** – For AI-powered information retrieval and processing.
- **LangGraph** – For structured multi-step reasoning workflows.
- **Streamlit** – For creating an interactive web interface.
- **Pipenv** – For managing dependencies and virtual environments.
